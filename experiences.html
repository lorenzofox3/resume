                    <h2>Amadeus IT</h2>

                    <p class="meta">January 2013-April 2014,Nice, France</p>

                    <p><em>Web/Software developer</em></p>

                    <p><em>Amadeus IT</em> is the biggest IT provider for travel industry in Europe and one of the
                        biggest in the world. My mission there was to build a customisation framework. Amadeus IT
                        develops standard web applications so that airlines, travel agencies, etc. can connect
                        to their central system to perform booking, check availability and other business operations.
                    </p>

                    <p>Some of the customers want to customize the standard applications. My team was in charge of
                        developing a framework so that these customers could write code (components) to be injected in
                        the standard web applications.
                        These components were versioned and hosted into git repositories by our framework and served as
                        a resource when activated so that the end user could enjoy the feature seamlessly compared to
                        the traditional web applications. We also offered an online development environment for the
                        customizers.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The core of the framework was developed in <em>Java</em></li>
                        <li>The online environment web application was built in <em>Java</em> for the server side and in
                            <a href="http://ariatemplates.com/">AriaTemplates</a> (in house MVC javascript Framework)
                            for the client side
                        </li>
                        <li>My team was following the <em>SCRUM</em> methodology with 3 weeks release cycles</li>

                    <p><em>Web developer</em></p>

                    <p><em>Amadeus IT</em> is the biggest IT provider for travel industry in Europe and one of the
                        biggest in the world. My mission there was to build a prototype to show how to link group
                        booking
                        (for flights) and <em>social platforms</em> (such Facebook). This mission was accomplished
                        following these following steps:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find the concept</li>
                        <li>Develop a web service around <em>REST</em> design concepts to serve data related to flights,
                            prices, etc. I used the <em>.NET</em> platform (C# + WCF)
                        </li>
                        <li>Develop a client application to consume the web services. I used <em>PHP</em> and
                            <em>MySQL</em> to develop a storage layer specific to the client application; and <em>Javascript</em>
                            to build a rich user interface
                        </li>
                        <li>Enhance user experience using <em>social APIs</em> (mainly Facebook)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Here is a video I recorded to promote my work during the internal intern contest.

                    <p class="meta">June 2010-July 2011, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</p>

                    <p><em>Software developer</em> for an oil & gas consulting company</p>

                    <p>My mission was to start the development of a software (Desktop) to help reservoir engineers in
                        their job. I was then joined by other software developers and the company has now a dedicated
                        development team.
                        The mission specifically included:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the development of the <em>algorithm</em> to forecast gas production based on the physics
                            (helped
                            by a
                            reservoir engineer)
                        </li>
                        <li>the development of a desktop <em>user interface</em> to increase engineer productivity</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The software was built using <em>.NET</em> platform ( C# + WPF) around <em>MVVM</em> design
                        pattern.

                    <p>
                        During this mission I built a portfolio website for a 3D Animator artist. The goal was to
                        promote his job with different sections and post regular news.

                    <ul>
                        <li>I have created a <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> in <em>PHP</em> and used
                            <em>MySQL</em>
                            as store. I could have used existing CMS such WordPress but as the dead line was not really
                            sharp, I took
                            the occasion to learn PHP.
